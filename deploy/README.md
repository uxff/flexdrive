the dir `flexdrivecode` is generated by xorm tools.

u can execute this below:
```
go get github.com/go-xorm/cmd/xorm
$GOPATH/src/github.com/go-xorm/cmd/xorm/xorm reverse mysql "user1:yourpass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/flexdrive" flexdrivetpl/ flexdrivecode/
```

before you execute it, u must make sure the tables are already created in the db.
after you executed that, u might mv codes to the dao dir.
